# TRNGorPRNG-PyorJava
A True Random Number Generator, depending on how much the maths portion of my brain have gone since I last used anything but basic "addition, subtraction, multiplication, division". If it's gone, then I might have to stick with a Pseudo-Random Number Generator. Either way this repo name is totally innapropriate because it's going to be embedded into a random base64-encode string generator for generating passwords with a high entropy and a more even distribution. This all sounds way over my head, but let's see how it goes and is I can do this without accidently infringing on some license for some algorithm that I didn't know. The full project, password generator and all with be hosted on my new GitLab. I still need to post a link to that on my README.md on here. I'll also post it in this repos README.md, just is ca.
